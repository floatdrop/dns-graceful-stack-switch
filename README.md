Synchronous DNS for node.js.

Why?
----

If you used node dns module with disabled IPv4 - you got exception (ENETUNREACH), but ```ping6 __address__``` working fine. In most cases __address__ was stored in configs (like config.js):

```javascript
{
	// ...
	database: "hostname.that.resolves.in.ipv6.net"	
	// ...
}
```

To fix this error with minimal amount of code (you still can use [```dns.resolve6```](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.8.25/api/dns.html#dns_dns_resolve6_domain_callback) and get valid IPv6 addresses, but asynchronous way) - synchronous dns binding was created.

```javascript
{
	// ...
	database: require('dns-sync').resolve("hostname.that.resolves.in.ipv6.net")	
	// ...
}
```
